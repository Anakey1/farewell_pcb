# Build Instructions for the v1 PCB

 1. Break out the PCB into the main PCB and the two back/front plate
 2. Cut out 3 mm of the 3 corners of the PCB to make room for the standoff (except the corner where the controller will be soldered)
 3. Put the diodes in each position (even at encoders and joystick location) and solder them. Be careful to put the diode in the correct direction.
 4. lower the plastic piece of both controler headers so that the pins are flush through the PCB
 5. Solder the controler headers from the top of the PCB (switch-side)
 6. Cut the headers'pins at 2 mm above the plastic spacers (diodes side)
 7. solder joystick and rotary encoders
 8. put the switches on your selected front plate and insert them on the PCB
 9. solder the switches
 10. position and solder the controler, components facing outwards
 11. mount the front plate to the back plate using the screws and standoffs on the 3 working corners.
